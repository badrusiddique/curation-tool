# Aurora Admin UI - Edit Mock

This is a lightweight React + Vite scaffold with edit screens for:
- Competition
- Team
- Individual
- Organisation

It is a frontend-only mock. No backend included. Each edit screen demonstrates:
- fields mapped from Aurora schema
- inline editing for dependent tables (periods, rosters, memberships)
- CSV import preview for bulk create/import

1. npm install
2. npm run dev
